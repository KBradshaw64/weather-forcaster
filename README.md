# weather-forcaster
Application to show the current and next five days of weather in a given city.

## Description

This web application was built to test my ability to implement and utilize a server-side API. The goal is to be able to search for any city (with or without state/country) and provide the current tempurature, wind speed, and humidity, as well as that data for each of the next 5 days at 12 noon. While that data is pulled and presented, it is not presented beautifully, and borderline not functionally (hard to read the forecast). Near the end of working on this project it was pointed out to me that the larger my code becomes, the more important it is to break-up and delegate functions to exist on their own - outside of the main "on-click" function. I also learned that I do not nearly have mastery over the local storage functionality. 

## Usage

To use this application, simply type in the name of the city you'd like to see the weather for. For example "Phoenix" or "London, GB". You may need to use the cities country in order to make sure you are viewing the correct city if there are multiple that share the name.

## Credits

I have to give credit to my classmates Kevin and Adam, as well as the TA Toacin for helping me figure out some of the looping functions and how to avoid nesting loops in this scenario. I visited multiple stackoverflow blog posts for minor syntax issues, and also viewed the class-repo to look at examples of loops, append(), and other code. No code was copied and pasted in my repository.
